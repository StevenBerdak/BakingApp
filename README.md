## General Information

This project is my submission for project 4 of the Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree program. For this project, we were required to build an app which displays recipe data from an API containing recipe information.

We were required to provide responsive views based on screen size, to provide a widget to show the ingredients for the last recipe viewed, query Json data from an API and then properly display it using the Master/Detail layout flow.

## Technologies Demonstrated

* Android Framework
* MySQL
* Json
* Java
* XML
